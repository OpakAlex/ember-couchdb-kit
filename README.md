ember-couchdb-kit
=================

Versions:

* `v0.7` works with (`ember rc.6.1` and `ember-data 0.13`)

An `ember-data` kit for Apache CouchDB.

We love a CouchDB and its RESTful and many other core things such as MVCC, attachments and /_changes. These all brings your data and application flow together as well.

Inspired by [pangratz/ember-couchdb-adapter](https://github.com/pangratz/ember-couchdb-adapter) and contains many fixes and newbie features.

There are some of these:

* natural `find/create/deleteRecord` functions;
* ability to work with `views`;
* document's attachements designed as `hasMany` relation;
* document's revisions designed as `belongsTo` relationship that points back such as corresponding `hasMany` relation;
* ability to work with `/_changes`;
